<h2>Designing future Emergency Departments with evidence and extended reality testing.</h2>
<p class="lede">EVIDENT (SNF funded, 2025–2028) is an interdisciplinary project led by researchers from ETH Zurich, University of Cambridge, and Northumbria University, with clinical & architectural partners. In the next few months, we are planning an international architectural competition and test selected designs in an extended reality simulation at the Swiss Centre for Design and Health.</p>

<h3>What we study</h3>
<p>Our central hypothesis is that <strong>visibility and connectivity</strong> within the Emergency Department strongly influence the location, frequency, and quality of personal interactions among healthcare workers. We will evaluate how <em>intelligible layouts</em> facilitate communication and coordination, and compare them with spatially dysfunctional (unintelligible) layouts that disrupt those processes.</p>

<h4>International competition</h4>
<p>Two parallel competitions: one for professionals (architects) and one for students. Winning designs will be prototyped in XR.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h4>XR testing</h4>
<p>Extended reality simulation at the Swiss Centre for Design and Health to test spatial behaviour and interaction.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h4>Empirical evaluation</h4>
<p>We will use tracking technologies, wearables, and video capture to measure interaction patterns with hired participants.</p>

<h3>Study design snapshot</h3>
<ul>
<li>Participants: ~20 healthcare workers + ~80 actors (patients & relatives)</li>
<li>Measurements: location tracking, wearable sensors, video capture</li>
<li>Comparisons: intelligible layout vs unintelligible layout</li>
</ul>
