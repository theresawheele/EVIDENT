<h2>International Architectural Competition: The ED of the Future</h2>
<p>We are organising an international architectural competition to design future Emergency Departments. Two parallel tracks will run: one for practicing architects and one for students. 
  Winning entries will be prototyped in an extended reality (XR) simulation at the Swiss Centre for Design and Health and evaluated experimentally.</p>

<h3>Study design & testing</h3>
<p>Each winning design will be tested under two spatial conditions:
<ul>
<li><strong>Intelligible layout</strong> — a layout designed to maximise visibility, clear circulation and connectivity (based on Hillier’s intelligible world & intelligible layout).</li>
<li><strong>Unintelligible layout</strong> — a spatial configuration designed to disrupt intelligibility and test effects on interaction.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Hypotheses</h3>
<p>We hypothesise that intelligible layouts will facilitate communication and coordination among healthcare workers, increasing the quality, frequency and spatial distribution of interactions compared to unintelligible layouts.</p>

<h3>Measurements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Location tracking technologies (indoor positioning)</li>
<li>Wearable sensors (for physiological and movement data)</li>
<li>Video capture for behavioural analysis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Participants</h3>
<p>We will recruit approximately <strong>20 healthcare workers</strong> and <strong>80 actors</strong> to play patients and relatives to create realistic scenarios.</p>

<h3>How to enter</h3>
<p>Competition details, submission guidelines and timelines will be posted here when available.</p>
