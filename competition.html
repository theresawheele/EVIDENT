<h2>EVIDENT International Architectural Design Competition: Designing the Emergency Department of the Future</h2>
<p>How can spatial design shape the quality of teamwork, communication, and care delivery in Emergency Departments?
What does an intelligible layout mean for visibility, collaboration, and patient safety—and what happens when this spatial logic is disrupted?</p>
  
 <p>The EVIDENT International Architectural Design Competition invites architects, designers, and students worldwide to envision the Emergency Department (ED) of the Future. We are searching for a design that utilises the built environment as a catalyst for clinical performance, collaboration, and innovation.</p> 
  
  <p>Two parallel tracks will run: 
  <p>Professional competition: Open to practicing architects and design teams</p>
  <p>Student competition: Open to students of architecture and related disciplines</p>

<h3>Mission</h3>
 <p>Funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF, 2025–2028), the EVIDENT project brings together partners from ETH Zurich, the University of Cambridge, Northumbria University, and leading healthcare and architectural institutions.
The competition aims to generate and test visionary ED designs that demonstrate how spatial layout affects healthcare team interactions and patient experience.<p/>  
 <p>Winning entries will be prototyped in an extended reality (XR) simulation at the Swiss Centre for Design and Health and evaluated experimentally.</p>

<h3>Design Challenge</h3>
<p>Participants are invited to propose an Emergency Department layout that explores spatial intelligibility:
Intelligible (high-visibility, high-connectivity) configurations that support fluid communication and teamwork
Unintelligible (spatially complex, visually fragmented) configurations that may challenge coordination

Designs should consider:
Patient, staff, and family experience
Realistic operational flow and emergency processes
Integration of digital technologies and flexible infrastructure
Evidence-based and human-centered design principles</p>

  <p>Each winning design will be tested under two spatial conditions:
<ul>
<li><strong>Intelligible layout</strong> — a layout designed to maximise visibility, clear circulation and connectivity (based on Hillier’s intelligible world & intelligible layout).</li>
<li><strong>Unintelligible layout</strong> — a spatial configuration designed to disrupt intelligibility and test effects on interaction.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Evaluation</h3>
<p>Entries will be judged by an international panel of experts in architecture, healthcare design, and spatial cognition. Proposals will be assessed for:
Conceptual clarity and originality
Evidence-based reasoning and spatial logic
Visual and technical quality of presentation
Potential to advance understanding of how design shapes healthcare teamwork</p>

  <h3>Eligibility</h3>
<p>The competition is open worldwide to individuals and teams of architects, designers, and students. Multidisciplinary collaborations are encouraged.
Competitors may submit one entry only. All submissions must be original and in English.</p>

    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p>Participants are required to submit:
Three A0 presentation boards (landscape orientation) with plans, sections, diagrams, and visualizations
A 500-word concept description explaining the design vision and its relation to spatial intelligibility
A short video (max. 3 minutes) presenting the proposal’s main ideas and design process

Accepted file formats: PDF, JPG, PNG, PPT, MP4 (video).
