      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        EVIDENT is an international research project (SNF 2025â€“2028) led by ETH Zurich, the University of Cambridge, Northumbria University, and healthcare and architecture partners. 
        We aim to explore how evidence-based design can improve communication and interaction in Emergency Departments (EDs).
      </p>
      <p>
        Our study will use extended reality simulations to test different hospital layouts designed through an international architectural competition.
        We hypothesize that more intelligible layouts will enhance coordination and teamwork among healthcare workers.

      <h2>Architectural Competition</h2>
      <p>
        The competition will be open to both professional architects and students, who will design future-ready Emergency Departments. 
        Winning designs will be tested using tracking technologies, wearable sensors, and simulated hospital environments.
