<h2>Designing future Emergency Departments with evidence and extended reality testing.</h2>
<p class="lede">EVIDENT (SNF funded, 2025–2028) is an interdisciplinary project led by researchers from ETH Zurich, University of Cambridge, Northumbria and clinical & architecture partners. 
  We will run an international architectural competition and test selected designs in an extended reality simulation at the Swiss Centre for Design and Health.</p>

<h3>What we study</h3>
<p>Our central hypothesis is that <strong>visibility</strong> within the Emergency Department strongly influence the communication and collaboration between Healthcare Workers, resulting in an improved quality of care for patients. 
  We will evaluate how <em>intelligible layouts</em> facilitate communication and coordination, and compare them with spatially dysfunctional (unintelligible) layouts that disrupt those processes.</p>

<h4>International competition</h4>
<p>Two parallel competitions: one for professionals (architects) and one for students. Winning designs will be prototyped in XR.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h4>XR testing</h4>
<p>Extended reality simulation at the Swiss Centre for Design and Health to test spatial behaviour and interaction.</p>
</article>
<article>
<h4>Empirical evaluation</h4>
<p>We will use tracking technologies, wearables, and video capture to measure interaction patterns with hired participants.</p>
